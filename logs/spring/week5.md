Dataset with no improvement:
![graph of AUM and threshold functions that don't intersection](../img/dataset.no.improvement.png)
The threshold functions don't intersect.

The maximum amount of intersections I've seen is 2.
![2 intersections showed up](../img/dataset.two.intersections.png)

I'm not sure how to replace minimizing the prediction vector with optimizing weights for a linear model.

Optimizing inidividual prediction vectors for each dataset/fold:

Not super useful but it's a start!
