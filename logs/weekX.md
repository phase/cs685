Algorithm is done!?

Notes 11/3:
- [ ] build speed tests
- prediction vector optimization vs linear weights
  - pred vec opt: doesnt learning anything
  - weight opt: does actual learning
- [this](https://github.com/tdhock/max-generalized-auc/blob/d7308ad6d650ffc785cef7a33d1d317c4f179499/figure-aum-optimized-data.R#L87-L96) can be replaced with my algorithm, figuring out the exact step sizes the aum changes at
- create visualization for traversing line intersections
